# Urban Forestry Management Project: Trees of Paris

## Project Overview

The Urban Forestry Management Project aims to analyze the urban tree population in Paris to inform and support city planning, maintenance strategies, and urban greening initiatives. Utilizing the "Trees of Paris" dataset, this project explores tree species diversity, distribution, and characteristics to enhance the city's resilience to climate change, improve biodiversity, and contribute to the well-being of Parisians.

## Objectives

- Assess the diversity and distribution of tree species within Paris.
- Identify areas with low tree density for targeted planting efforts.
- Recommend climate-resilient tree species for future planting initiatives.
- Analyze the relationship between tree characteristics and urban heat island mitigation potential.
- Provide insights and recommendations to support Paris's urban forestry management strategies.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project contains information about the trees managed by the City of Paris, including species, location, size, and notable status. The data was cleaned and processed to ensure accuracy and relevance for analysis.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Removal of irrelevant columns and handling missing values.
   - Standardization of species names and extraction of arrondissement information.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analysis of species diversity and distribution.
   - Visualization of tree sizes (height and circumference) and their implications for urban forestry management.

3. **Geospatial Analysis:**
   - Identification of areas with low tree density and high urban heat index for targeted greening efforts.

4. **Species Recommendation:**
   - Identification of climate-resilient species suitable for enhancing urban biodiversity and resilience.

## Key Insights

- The current urban forest in Paris exhibits a significant variety of tree species, with a dominance of certain species such as *x hispanica* and *Aesculus hippocastanum*.
- Areas with lower tree densities were identified, highlighting opportunities for targeted planting to address urban heat islands and improve air quality.
- Recommendations for climate-resilient species were provided to support Paris's adaptation to climate change and urban challenges.

## Recommendations

- **Targeted Planting:** Focus on increasing tree density in identified priority areas to mitigate urban heat islands and enhance green coverage.
- **Diversity Enhancement:** Diversify the urban forest by incorporating a wider range of climate-resilient species.
- **Public Engagement:** Engage the community through participatory planting initiatives and educational programs to foster a sense of stewardship and raise awareness of urban forestry benefits.

## Visualizations

This project includes a series of Plotly visualizations that offer interactive insights into the distribution of tree species, tree sizes, and potential areas for targeted greening efforts within Paris.

## Conclusion

The Urban Forestry Management Project provides valuable insights into the state of Paris's urban forest and offers data-driven recommendations to enhance its ecological, social, and economic benefits. By strategically managing its urban forest, Paris can continue to thrive as a resilient, green, and livable city.
